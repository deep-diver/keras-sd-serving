# Various ways of serving Stable Diffusion 

This repository shows a various ways to deploy Stable Diffusion. Currently, we are interested in the Stable Diffusion implementation from `keras-cv`. The codes inside every notebooks are written based on `keras-cv == 0.3.4`.

> NOTE: `keras-cv >= 0.3.5` is released, but it was not registered in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/keras-cv/) at the time of creating this repository. When it is distributed to PyPI, the notebooks will be updated accordingly.

## 1. All in One Endpoint (w/ ðŸ¤— Endpoint)

</a>

This method shows how to create a [custom handler](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/custom_handler) of Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Endpoint. Stable Diffusion consists of three models(`encoder`, `diffusion model`, `decoder`) and some glue codes to handle the inputs and outputs of each models. In this scenario, everything is packaged into a single Endpoint. Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Endpoint let us easily deploy any machine learning models with pre/post processing logics in custom handler.

## 2. Three Endpoints (w/ ðŸ¤— Endpoint)

</a>

This is written based on the **Stable Diffusion with Three Endpoints** notebook. This notebook shows how to deploy Diffusion Model into Hugging Face Endpoint while having Encoder/Decoder in a local environment. So, you will see how to separate each parts into different environment.

## 4. One Endpoint with Two APIs on local for inpainting (w/ ðŸ¤— Endpoint)

</a>

This is written based on the **Inpainting with Custom Handler** notebook. This notebook shows how to deploy Diffusion Model(inpainting task) into Hugging Face Endpoint while keeping other parts remained as is to demonstrate the flexibility.
